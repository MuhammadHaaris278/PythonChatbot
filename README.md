# PythonChatbot with NLP
This Python-based chatbot leverages NLTK and spaCy for natural language processing. It features:

Intent Recognition: Identifies user intents such as greetings, farewells, thanks, weather, time inquiries, and jokes.
Entity Extraction: Uses spaCy to extract entities from user input.
Personalization: Remembers user names for a personalized interaction.
Randomized Responses: Provides varied responses to keep interactions engaging.
Logging: Records conversations and errors for troubleshooting.
Run the chatbot to interact with it via a console-based interface. Use use_spacy=True to enable spaCy processing or use_spacy=False for NLTK.
